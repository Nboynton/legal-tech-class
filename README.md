# Legal Tech Class
The aim of this project is to create a collaboratively built textbook for teaching law school classes about legal technology.

[Quinten Steenhuis](https://nonprofittechy.com) is the author and editor of almost all of the content as of 2020, so the material
reflects his interests and biases. However, he hopes to encourage collaboration from many sources, and the material will
start to become a centralized library reflecting many overlapping goals.

All content is released under a Creative Commons [Non-commercial Attribution/Share-alike license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/).

The website itself is a series of Markdown files presented via [Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/). 

It now includes:

* Practical exercises and assignments for teaching the [Docassemble](https://docassemble.org) platform
* Practical guides to building document assembly and expert systems using Docassemble
* Reading lists for different legal technology topics
* Information and essays about the access to justice problem
* Essays and synopses on other software development and broad legal tech topics, such as the future of the legal profession
* Hierarchies and taxonomies of legal technology
* Syllabi that can help professors create their own legal tech classes

The goal is to also cover related systems, including:
* QnA Markup
* A2J Author
* Hotdocs
