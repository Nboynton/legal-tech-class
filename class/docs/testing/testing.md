## Why test?

## Forms of testing

### Manual testing

### Using scenarios

Kevin Mulcahy of Neota Logic has advocated the strategy of creating scenarios. This can help both with planning
and with testing a built application.

### Testing checklists

Angela Tripp at Michigan Legal Help says that her program makes extensive use of checklists to help with ensuring
quality legal applications.

### Automating testing with Aloe and Selenium

## Test driven development

## When is testing complete?

No software has finished testing before it is in the hand of real-world users. Your users will find bugs that the
most carefully planned testing will miss. You need a plan to gather feedback from your app once it is released
in order to catch these late bugs.
