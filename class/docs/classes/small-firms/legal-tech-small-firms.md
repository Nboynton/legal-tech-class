Meeting time: 2 PM - 3:50 PM, Mondays, Fall 2020

The practice of law is increasingly built around digital tools. Lawyers who
understand technology have an advantage in the marketplace, both to reduce their
operating costs and to help more people. Lawyers today use technology to:

* Run the business side of the law firm, including
    * Tracking client information
    * Reaching new clients
* Help make decisions
* Reduce repetitive tasks through automation and templates
* Deliver legal services directly to litigants

This class will provide you a survey of the world of legal technology, with
special attention to tools that are free or low cost and useful to owners and
practitioners in small firms. In the second half of the class, you will produce
a final project using one of the tools that we learned in class to solve a legal
problem.
