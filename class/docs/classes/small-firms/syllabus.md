Website: https://nonprofittechy.com

### Course Information
Meetings: Mondays, 2:00-3:50  
Prerequisites: None

### Materials

You do not need to purchase any materials.

The [class website](classes/small-firms/legal-tech-small-firms.md)
is the "home base" for this class. Links to readings and required videos
will be posted there in advance of each class.

#### Software tools
We will make use of some of the following free websites and software applications:

*	GitHub (https://github.com) 
*	Slack (https://slack.com) 
*	Docassemble (https://docassemble.org) (Instructor will provide server information)
*	QnAMarkup (https://qnamarkup.org) 
*	Community.Lawyer (https://community.lawyer) 
* Clio (https://clio.com)

You will not need to install any software on your computer. All work will require
an active Internet connection.

### Office Hours

The best way to reach me is by messaging me on Slack. I am usually available
during normal working hours for quick questions. If I am not available, we
can set up a meeting at a later time. I am also available for impromptu Zoom
meetings to work through problems you may run into with the assignments or
questions about class.

## Online learning expectations

Online learning presents a challenge to a seminar-style class. I expect active
participation, although Zoom makes it easy to be working silently on something
else while the class is on in the background. Please come prepared to engage in
each class.

* Attend every real-time class, all semester long, except for excused absences.
  I will make use of a "flipped" classroom at times throughout the semester to
  reduce "Zoom fatigue." I may replace some regular meetings with one-on-one
  check-ins.
* **Join with video camera on.** I encourage you to select an appropriate virtual
  background to protect your privacy.
* Be an active participant in discussions. If your home situation makes it more
  challenging to have your microphone on, please let me know in advance so we
  can find an appropriate accommodation.

## Assignments/Exams/Papers/Projects

Students will be evaluated in the following areas: 

There will be a modest amount of background reading and/or online video for most
classes.  But the key requirement in this course is to make something that does
useful legal work - i.e., a software application that assists someone with a
non-trivial legal task.  That will require analyzing, designing, planning, and
managing a project.  See the Project Work column in the course schedule below
for more details.  Important advice:  Start Early!  Backup your work frequently!

### Grading/Evaluation
You will be evaluated in the following areas: 

*	preparation for, and participation in, class discussions
*	timely completion of assignments
*	quality of project analysis, design, and implementation

The grade breakdown is as follows: 

* 50% on progress/completion of final project;
* 10% Legal Tech Assessment (advanced Microsoft Office and Acrobat skills);
* 20% on participation;
* 20% on weekly journal entries.

Attendance and punctuality are basic requirements for an effective discussion-
and project-based course. Your frequency and quality of contribution to
discussions will be assessed and reflected in your grade. If you cannot attend a
class please inform me in advance.  We will be keeping records of attendance.

I measure class participation based on the following criteria: arriving on time;
paying attention to presentations and discussions; respectfully listening when
others are speaking; making thoughtful contributions; being fully engaged in
your learning without texting, checking your phone or email, or participating in
other digital distractions.

### Accommodations
If you anticipate issues related to the format or requirements of this course
due to the impact of a disability, it is important that you contact the Law
School's Dean of Student Office for further information and assistance,
including information on disability-related accommodations. We can then plan how
best to coordinate any accommodations. 

### Attendance Policy
Observe Suffolk Law School's general attendance policy. In the event that the
University cancels classes, such as for severe weather, you are expected to
continue with assignments as originally scheduled. Any assignments scheduled
during those missed classes are due at the next class meeting unless other
instructions are posted at the course website or communicated via email. 

### Course Schedule
The schedule, policies, procedures, and assignments are subject to change
in the event of extenuating circumstances, by mutual agreement, or to ensure
better student learning.  This course is a work in progress, and I'm always
looking for ways to improve.  Therefore, mid-course corrections should be
anticipated! This online version will be the most "up to date," so if you print
this, just be aware that the "official" version will be the digital version
available at this web page.
