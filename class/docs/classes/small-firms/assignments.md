  (https://www.clio.com/partnerships/academic-access/) and poke around the site for a few minutes
 
2. Read Troman's short article, "Law Firms Are Inefficiency Factories,
   Automation is the Cure"
   (https://www.artificiallawyer.com/2018/06/11/law-firms-are-inefficiency-factories-automation-is-the-cure/).
   Be prepared to discuss it.

After class:

3. Write a [brief

   about the readings and class discussion.

## Week 2, 8/31: Clio Session 1

Read the 2018 and 2019 Clio Trends Reports and the Covid impact report.

If you prefer not to register to download the report, I will send a PDF.

https://www.clio.com/resources/legal-trends/covid-impact/ 

Spend some time working through Clio Products Essentials Course.  You needn't
have finished it by this point, but the more you do in advance of 8/31, the more
meaningful this session will be.

After class: [write a brief
reflection](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=qT9zeA5UuE6_KXPE7rY0EvfCmbvxns1Fu0wRF1ZKxuFUNFc1MkNLM0hNOTNDVTJUSDkxOVUyNkYxSS4u).

## 9/7 Labor Day, no class

Enjoy the holiday! After Monday, this may be a good week to get started with the
[Legal Tech Assessment](https://ltaweb.azurewebsites.net/), which is due on the
final day of class.

Expect to spend a few days working through the training and assessment portions.
You can retake the assessment portion as needed.

## Week 5 9/28: Hello, World in Docassemble

**Before class**:

[Docassemble](https://docassemble.org) is the foundation for Community.Lawyer,
and allows much more advanced automations. It is also completely free and
customizable, but takes more time and experience to develop in and to host.

Make sure you have an account on the Suffolk LIT Lab Docassemble server,
https://apps-dev.suffolklitlab.org. NOTE: this server is for Suffolk Law
Students, only.

Follow-along with the training from this year's Docacon below. **You only need
to listen until about 1:45**, which covers the Hello, World exercise and the
logic section. You can skip the Docx example which takes place in the second
half of the training.

The video includes breaks, questions, and introduction which you do not need to
watch. Feel free to watch at a higher speed as well.

Also see the training materials, which are hosted as part of this [legal tech
text book](classes/docacon-2020/hello-world).

We will meet for a shorter period, 30 minutes, this week to answer your questions about
the Hello, World exercise.

After class: do the stretch goals for both the [Hello,
World](http://localhost:3000/legal-tech-class/docs/classes/docacon-2020/hello-world#your-assignment)
and the
[Logic](https://suffolklitlab.org/legal-tech-class/docs/classes/docacon-2020/logic#your-assignment)
sections of the training.

Turn in a hello_world.yml and logic.yml file via [the Microsoft
Form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ShareFormPage.aspx?id=qT9zeA5UuE6_KXPE7rY0EvfCmbvxns1Fu0wRF1ZKxuFURUJIQ1NYUFNXM1pMWlhIS0hTOVRCUzJaQy4u&sharetoken=O1ZBtGGZvuhPGE84Bhse).

## Week 8 10/19: Free Tool Fiesta

## Week 9 10/26: Community Lawyer, Advanced Skills

For many students, using community.lawyer will make sense for their final
project.  To prepare for this meeting, spend some time looking at
community.lawyer's documentation for a sense of what questions you might have
about how to build conditional logic into your app.

Forward](https://www.lawyerforward.com/).

Check out this post on [alternative legal research
tools](https://guides.library.harvard.edu/alternatelegaldatabases) and click the
links/watch the embedded videos.

After class: run a search for Plessy v. Ferguson, Roe v. Wade, or any other
landmark constitutional law cases that interest you in at least 2 search tools
that are new to you, and one that you know well (such as Lexis/Westlaw).

What do you like about the alternative tool? What is missing?

## Week 13 11/23: Presentation of student projects.

Please come prepared to deliver a 5 minute presentation of your work. See [final
project guidelines](rubric.md) for more information about how to structure your
presentation. Slides are welcome, but not required.

You do not need to have your final project finished. Be ready to demonstrate what
you have, explain your process, and tell us about the work that is still to come.
A working prototype will be able to get more constructive feedback, but your
grade will not be based on how complete the work is, but rather the quality of
the presentation.

Come prepared to present/provide constructive critique of classmates' work.

Legal Tech Assessment is due.

## November 30th: No class, Wednesday Schedule.

During the week, get started incorporating feedback on your final project.

## December 7th, 5 PM

Final project is due.
