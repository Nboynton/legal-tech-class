## Potential Project ideas

Please see the brief descriptions of potential projects below. If you are interested, I can play matchmaker and obtain more information about any of them.

### Housing search log
One problem that tenants face is obtaining subsidized housing. Often they apply to many waiting lists. When you are homeless, waiting to get housed, it's difficult to keep track of the places you apply. However, every year each place you apply will require you to send them a letter confirming that you want to stay on the waitlist. This letter often gets lost and tenants have to reapply.

Potential partners: [Homestart](https://www.homestart.org) or [Rosie's Place](https://www.rosiesplace.org)

### Intake for HomeStart

[Homestart](https://www.homestart.org) is looking for a partner that might help them produce a useful online screening intake to help people who need assistance paying their rent.

### Guided interview for Asian Outreach Project at Greater Boston Legal Services

The Asian Outreach Unit is looking to create a guided interview that can produce pleadings to file in court. They were inspired by [MADE](https://www.gbls.org/MADE). I can obtain more information about their project idea.

### Annotated Index Generator for Harvard Immigration and Refugee Program at GBLS

This project has some working code already. You'd be evaluated on the new work. The project would help asylum lawyers prepare the massive "annotated indices" that support an asylum claim. Specifically, it would focus on gathering "country conditions' which mix different attributes of an asylum seeker (e.g., gang violence or ethnicity) with a time period and country.

### Guided interview for School to Prison Pipeline

The [School to Prison Pipeline project](https://www.gbls.org/our-work/elder-health-disability/school-to-prison-pipeline-intervention-project) focuses on school discipline. There are very few staff. They would like to create some guided interviews to help students on their own.

### How to e-file : user friendly guide

E-filing is a new and potentially exciting opportunity for low-income and pro se litigants in Massachusetts. It can make it easier for people who can't leave work or can't pay for the T fare to get to court on time. However, there is a big learning curve. Creating a video and guided interview to guide litigants could be very helpful. There is likely some information from Tyler (the e-filing vendor) to look at first--I am not sure how comprehensive or high quality it is.

### How much do you qualify for in TAFDC

It is enormously complicated to understand both whether you qualify for welfare benefits (TAFDC) and how much you qualify for. You could work on this project with an attorney at GBLS or [MLRI](https://www.mlri.org), or any legal aid program.

### Legal Resource Finder triage tool screeners/advice tools

Community Legal Aid recently received a Technology Initiative Grant from the Legal Services Corporation to improve the [Legal Resource Finder](https://www.masslegalservices.org/FindLegalAid). As part of this grant, they would like to create 5 short screeners to address different housing topics. For example: 
    * https://a2j.documate.org/interview?i=docassemble.playground81%3AHousing+v3+Multiple+Issues.yml#page1 (this is very rough but gives you an idea of what they want)

You would work with Community Legal Aid (Springfield) and Mass Law Reform Institute on this project. They are very interested in having volunteers. This would be a good team project and will definitely live on.

### Guide someone on using the right leave policy

Helping people figure out the best leave to use when they need to take time off from work for personal or family needs. You would work with [MLRI](https://www.mlri.org) on this project.
